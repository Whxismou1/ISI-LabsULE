1.3.1. Based on the previous result, which two features have (on average) the smallest values
and the largest values?
    The smallest two features are on average FlightTrans (1.373593) 
    and BonusTrans (11.6019)


1.3.2. Why is it important to normalize the data before clustering?
    It is important because it eliminates scaling effects. This aids in measuring distances, 
    which are used by most clustering techniques.
    
1.4.1. What are the mean and standard deviation of the features in the standardized dataset?

1.4.2. Based on the normalized dataset descriptive stats, which two features have (on average)
the smallest values and the largest values?
    The smallest value: BonusTrans (-7.817925e-17)
    Largest value: QualMiles (6.574164e-17)

2.1.1.1 Compared to the other clusters, Cluster 1 has the largest average values in which features
(if any)? Based on this, how would you describe the Airline’s customers in Cluster 1?
    They have the highest average values in Balance, BonusMiles, BonusTrans, FlightMiles, and FlightTrans, 
    indicating they are highly engaged and loyal customers who frequently fly with the airline, actively 
    participate in the loyalty program, and have accumulated many bonus miles.

2.1.1.2 Applied the previous analysis to the remaining four clusters and describe them.
    Cluster 2:
        Consists of customers who are less engaged and loyal to the airline, with fewer miles accumulated. 
        They are likely infrequent flyers and less active in the loyalty program, resulting in lower rewards
        and benefits compared to other clusters.
    
    Cluster 3:
        Has the lowest average values in FlightTrans, QualMiles, BonusMiles, BonusTrans, and FlightMiles. 
        These customers are somewhat engaged with the loyalty program but do not frequently fly with the airline,
        resulting in lower qualifying and average flight miles.
    
    Cluster 4:
        Has the highest BonusMiles on average. This cluster likely represents customers who are highly engaged 
        with the loyalty program and have accumulated a high balance of miles but may not necessarily be the most frequent flyers.
    
    Cluster 5:
        Represents customers with a moderate level of engagement in the loyalty program, who are moderately
        frequent flyers, and have accumulated a moderate balance of miles.

2.1.2.1 Describe the relationship between the parameter k and the obtained sum of squared
errors.
    We observe that higher values of k result in less error. The optimal k would be 
    the number of samples (resulting in zero error), but this is not practical for a classifier.

2.1.2.2 Based on the results, indicate the optimal parameter k, that you consider appropriate to
clustering the Airlines Cluster dataset.
    Probably a k value near 8.






2.2.1 Do you expect that Cluster 1 of the Hierarchical clustering to be necessarily similar to KMeans
clustering? Compare the results obtained using K-Means and Hierarchical clustering.
    It is not necessary for both methods to produce the same "Cluster 1." Comparing the obtained results,
    we can confirm that the "Cluster 1" from each method is different, as they have significantly different
    average values.

2.2.2 Compared to the other hierarchical clusters, Cluster 1 has the largest average values in
which features (if any)? Based on this, how would you describe the Airline’s customers in
Cluster 1? Applied the previous analysis to the remaining four clusters and describe them.
    Cluster 1 has the largest average values only in QualMiles.

    Cluster 1:
    These customers may be frequent flyers who primarily earn miles through flights, but also engage in some non-flight bonus activities.
    
    Cluster 2:
    These customers are likely high-value customers who engage in various activities to earn miles and have a large balance of miles available for award travel.
    
    Cluster 3:
    These customers may be infrequent flyers who earn most of their miles through non-flight bonus activities.
    
    Cluster 4:
    These customers may be occasional flyers who engage in some non-flight bonus activities but do not earn a significant number of miles.
    
    Cluster 5:
    These customers may be infrequent or non-flying members who have accumulated a small number of miles through occasional activities.

2.2.3 Perform a new hierarchical clustering of the AirlineCluster Dataset using a different
linkage method and compare with the clustering obtained using the ‘ward’ method. Explain
what happens.
    Using the 'single' method (Nearest Point Algorithm) results in almost every point being in the same cluster, except for 3 points, which create their own separate clusters. This approach produces worse results than the previous one.


2.3.1 The estimated number of clusters and noise points in the three previous
scenarios
    Scenario a - Estimated number of clusters: 5
    Scenario a - Estimated number of noise points: 2297

    Scenario b - Estimated number of clusters: 12
    Scenario b - Estimated number of noise points: 1940

    Scenario c - Estimated number of clusters: 7
    Scenario c - Estimated number of noise points: 3018

2.3.2 Explain how decreasing “eps” affects to the estimated number of clusters
    When we decrease eps, points that are far away are not considered part of the same cluster. This typically leads to a higher number of clusters, as shown in the results.

2.3.3 Explain how decreasing “min_samples” affects to the estimated number of
clusters
    When decreasing min_samples, fewer points are needed to consider a region as dense. This makes it easier for regions to be considered clusters instead of noise. Therefore, there are more clusters and fewer noise points in this scenario.
